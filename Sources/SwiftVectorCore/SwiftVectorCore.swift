/// SwiftVectorCore provides foundational protocols for deterministic AI control systems.

/// Core concepts:
/// - `State`: deterministic, hashable state snapshots
/// - `Action`: proposed state transitions
/// - `Reducer`: pure functions that validate and apply actions
/// - `Effect`: descriptions of side effects executed outside reducers
